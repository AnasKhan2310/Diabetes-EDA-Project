# 🩺 Diabetes EDA Project  

This repository contains an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset.  
The main goal is to clean the data, explore distributions, and identify key patterns related to diabetes outcomes.  

---

## 📂 Project Overview  
- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset (replaced invalid zeros with median values)  
- Explored target variable distribution (Diabetes vs No Diabetes)  
- Visualized Age, BMI distributions and key features using histograms  
- Compared Glucose, Blood Pressure, Age vs Diabetes Outcome using boxplots  
- Created a correlation heatmap to identify important features  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** for data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** for visualization  

---

## 📊 Insights  
- Diabetic individuals tend to have **higher Glucose, BMI, and Age**  
- The dataset shows **class imbalance**  
- Handling invalid zeros was crucial for accurate analysis  
- Correlation matrix highlights important predictors for modeling

## 🚀 Next Steps  
This EDA sets a strong foundation for predictive modeling using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.
